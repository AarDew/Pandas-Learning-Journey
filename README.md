# Pandas Learning Journey

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents my structured learning journey with Pandas using Jupyter Notebooks.
It contains topic-wise notebooks created while learning and practicing core Pandas concepts
before moving on to full exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects.

Although I have prior experience with Python from academic labs (Data Science, ML, AI),
this repository focuses on rebuilding a strong hands-on foundation specifically for
data analysis workflows.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Reading data from CSV, Excel, JSON, and TXT files
- Filtering and ordering rows and columns
- Indexing operations
- GroupBy and aggregation functions
- Merging multiple DataFrames
- Creating basic visualizations using Pandas

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder represents a specific Pandas concept and contains:
- A Jupyter Notebook with explanations and examples
- Real datasets used for hands-on practice

## 🎯 Purpose
- Build a strong Pandas foundation
- Practice data manipulation with real datasets
- Prepare for advanced EDA and analysis projects

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Perform full EDA on real-world datasets
- Combine Pandas with visualization libraries
- Build end-to-end data analysis projects
